# PaySurity Launch Readiness Report
**Date:** April 11, 2025

## Executive Summary

This report details the results of comprehensive end-to-end testing of the PaySurity platform, identifying critical areas that need to be addressed before launch. The core functionality of the system is working properly with API endpoints functioning correctly, performance metrics within acceptable ranges, and database connectivity for core functionality working as expected.

However, several key subsystems have failing tests that need to be resolved. This document outlines these issues and provides recommendations for remediation.

## Test Results Overview

### Passing Systems
- API Infrastructure (100% passing)
- Performance Metrics (100% passing)
- Core Database Functionality (100% passing)
- Delivery Service (100% passing)
- System Utilities (100% passing)

### Failing Systems
- Wallet System (0% passing)
- Merchant Onboarding (25% passing)
- POS Systems (12% passing)
- Affiliate System (15% passing)

## Critical Issues by Priority

- Missing transaction tables
- Wallet API endpoints return incorrect status codes
- Security endpoint issues

**Required Actions:**
1. Create the wallet tables in the database schema
2. Implement transaction handling functionality
3. Fix API endpoint authorization handling
4. Complete wallet security features

### Priority 2: Merchant Onboarding
Merchant onboarding is essential for acquiring new customers and must be functional.

**Issues Found:**
- Verification system incomplete
- Payment gateway integration tests failing
- Microsite generation not fully implemented

**Required Actions:**
1. Complete verification API endpoints
2. Fix Helcim payment integration for merchant accounts
3. Implement microsite generation and configuration

### Priority 3: POS Systems
Industry-specific POS solutions are key differentiators for PaySurity.

**Issues Found:**
- Restaurant POS (BistroBeast) tables and endpoints missing
- Retail POS (ECom Ready) functionality incomplete
- Common POS infrastructure needs implementation

**Required Actions:**
1. Prioritize implementation of BistroBeast and Retail POS systems
2. Complete API endpoints for order creation and processing
3. Implement inventory management functionality

### Priority 4: Affiliate System
The affiliate system will drive customer acquisition post-launch.

**Issues Found:**
- Registration functionality incomplete
- Referral tracking mechanism missing
- Commission system needs implementation

**Required Actions:**
1. Complete affiliate profile management
2. Implement referral tracking with unique codes
3. Build commission calculation system

## Database Schema Updates Required

Based on test failures, the following database tables need to be created or modified:

1. wallets
2. wallet_transactions
3. payment_methods
4. merchant_applications
5. merchant_verifications
6. merchant_payment_gateways
7. merchant_microsite_settings
8. restaurant_tables
9. restaurant_orders
10. restaurant_menu_items
11. restaurant_order_items
12. retail_products
13. retail_inventory
14. retail_sales
15. affiliate_profiles
16. merchant_referrals
17. affiliate_commissions
18. affiliate_payouts

## API Endpoints to Implement

Key API endpoints that need to be implemented for launch:

### Wallet System
- GET /api/wallets/balance
- GET /api/wallets/transactions
- POST /api/wallets/transactions
- GET /api/wallets/payment-methods
- POST /api/wallets/payment-methods

### Merchant System
- POST /api/merchants/applications
- GET /api/merchants/verification/status
- POST /api/merchants/verification/documents
- PUT /api/merchants/microsite-settings

### POS System
- GET /api/pos/locations
- GET/POST /api/pos/inventory
- GET/POST /api/pos/staff
- GET/POST /api/pos/payments

### Affiliate System
- GET /api/affiliates/profile
- GET /api/affiliates/referrals
- GET /api/affiliates/track
- GET /api/affiliates/commissions
- GET /api/affiliates/payouts
- PUT /api/affiliates/microsite-settings

## Conclusion

While the core infrastructure of PaySurity is solid with passing API, performance, and system tests, several key functional subsystems need urgent attention. The priority order for fixing these issues should be:

1. Wallet System
2. Merchant Onboarding
3. POS Systems (prioritizing BistroBeast and Retail)
4. Affiliate System

By addressing these issues systematically, we can ensure a successful launch of the PaySurity platform with all critical functionality working properly.
