Tips for Implementation
Prioritize long-tail keywords (e.g., “integrated payroll and payment solutions”) for lower competition and higher conversion intent.

Use location-based terms (e.g., “payment processor in New York”) if targeting specific regions.

Create content around pain points (e.g., “how to reduce payment processing fees”).

Target competitor comparisons (e.g., “Paysurity vs Square”) to capture competitor traffic.

Pair these keywords with blog posts, service pages, and case studies to drive organic traffic and merchant sign-ups!
