Law firms use the below as billing reasons/ billing line items. Add them accordingly. During onboarding, allow the Law firm to choose the type of law-practice they are, and load the billing line items for them accordingly. Always include a customizable "Custom Service" field, as 23% of firms use practice-specific line items, by enabling them to press "Add Custom Service", and adding a field that we have not provided.


My question to Deepseek AI:
If I am building a system for lawyers, I need to know the exact nomenclatures of the services that the law firms create their billing line-items with. Give me that list of line items.

2.	"Non-Refundable Engagement Fee" (if permitted by state bar)
3.	"Earned Upon Receipt" (for flat fees treated as earned immediately)
4.	"Trust Balance: $X.XX" (required on all invoices per ABA Rule 1.15)
________________________________________
Key Technical Requirements for Developers
1.	Trust Accounting Safeguards:
o	Auto-label transactions as "Trust" or "Operating"
o	Prevent negative trust balances with real-time validation
o	Generate 3-way reconciliation reports (client ledger ⇨ trust ledger ⇨ bank statement)
2.	Billing Precision:
o	Time tracking in 6-minute increments (0.1 hours)
o	Auto-apply jurisdictional tax rules (e.g., NY exempts legal services from sales tax)
3.	Ethical Walls:
o	Matter-based access controls
o	Conflict check logging
________________________________________
This list aligns with ABA Model Rules and the Uniform Task-Based Management System (UTBMS) codes used in legal e-billing. Always include a customizable "Custom Service" field, as 23% of firms use practice-specific line items







My Question to Deepseek AI:
What kind of reports do the law firms run? how often they run them? Give me the names of 100 most common reports, and the metadata for each. Give your output in the shape of a table. With one report in each row i.e. report name, description, metadata (give one real-data example of each Metadata).

Developer Implementation Notes
1.	Parameterization: Use dynamic SQL with placeholders (e.g., @StartDate, @MatterType).
2.	Caching: Precompute monthly/quarterly reports to reduce database load.
3.	Permissions: Restrict access to trust/compliance reports to authorized roles.
