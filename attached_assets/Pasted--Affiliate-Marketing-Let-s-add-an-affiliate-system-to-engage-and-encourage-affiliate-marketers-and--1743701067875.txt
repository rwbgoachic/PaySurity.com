 Affiliate Marketing
Let’s add an affiliate system to engage and encourage affiliate marketers and keep them motivated:
 Payout Structure
1.	First Payout ($25):
o	Trigger: Customer does not cancel within 7 days.
o	Clawback: If customer cancels before Day 30 and transactions < 2,500,reclaim2,500,reclaim25.
2.	Second Payout ($25):
o	Trigger: Customer active for 30 days and processes ≥ $2,500.
3.	Third Payout (25+25+3.75):
o	Trigger: Customer active for 90 days and processes ≥ $7,500 total.
o	Formula: $25 + (5% of PaySurity’s commission from Days 1–90).
4.	Fourth Payout (25+25+9.38):
o	Trigger: Customer processes ≥ $15,000 between Days 91–180.
o	Formula: $25 + (6.25% of PaySurity’s commission from Days 91–180).
5.	Recurring Payout (25+25+3.75/month):
o	Trigger: Customer processes ≥ $5,000/month after Day 180.
6.	Loyalty Bonus (25+25+5/month):
o	Trigger: Customer active 365+ days and processes ≥ $5,000/month.
7.	Volume Bonuses:

10.	Automation Requirements
o	Email Alerts: Use Zapier to notify affiliates when:
o	They earn their first payout.
o	A payout milestone is reached (e.g., “Earn another $25 if [Customer] stays 90 days!”).
11.	Transparency Dashboard:
o	Affiliates see real-time stats:
o	Pending earnings (e.g., “Pending $25”).
o	Earned payouts (e.g., “Earned $28.75”).
o	Recurring/loyalty earnings (e.g., “$30/month”).

12.	Legal & Safety
o	Add clause: “PaySurity reserves the right to modify payout terms at any time.”
o	Collect “Next-of-Kin” details during affiliate signup for payout continuity.

17.	Safety Checks
18.	Profit Protection: All thresholds ensure PaySurity’s 1% commission covers payouts.
19.	Example: A 5,000/month∗∗customerearnsPaySurity∗∗5,000/month∗∗customerearnsPaySurity∗∗50. Your payout is $28.75 (57.5% of our revenue). This is aggressive but viable if customer retention is high.
20.	Recommendation: Monitor margins and adjust thresholds if needed.
