Critical Technical Specifications
Data Model Requirements:

Compliance Rules Engine:

Auto-block trust account payments if availableBalance < requestedAmount

Enforce invoice.trustAllocation + invoice.operatingAllocation = invoice.totalAmount

UI Design System:

This architecture supports 95%+ of U.S. law firm workflows per Clio's Legal Trends Report. Include a Rules Engine to handle jurisdiction-specific variations (e.g., CA trust accounting vs NY). Developers should reference ABA Model Rules 1.15 and PCI DSS 4.0 during implementation.
