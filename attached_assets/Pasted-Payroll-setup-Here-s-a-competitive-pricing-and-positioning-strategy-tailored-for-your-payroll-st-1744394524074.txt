Strategic Positioning for Fast Sales
1.	Niche Targeting:
o	Micro/SMB Focus: Underprice Gusto/ADP for businesses with <50 employees.
o	Gig Economy: Dominate contractor-heavy verticals (e.g., startups, agencies) with free tiers.
o	Global Startups: Beat Remote/Deel on price for early-stage companies hiring overseas.
2.	Messaging:
o	“ADP’s Features at Gusto’s Price—But 50% Cheaper.”
o	“No Surprise Fees. Ever.” (contrast with QuickBooks/Wave tax upcharges).
o	“24/7 Support, Not 24/7 Upsells.” (differentiate from enterprise vendors).
3.	Upsell Pathways:
o	AI Add-Ons: $10/month for predictive payroll analytics or ChatGPT-driven HR bot.
o	PEO Services: Partner with a white-label provider to offer benefits/insurance.
4.	Sales Triggers:
o	Free Migration: Offer to handle data transfers from competitors (e.g., QuickBooks → your platform).
o	Referral Bonuses: $100 credit for client referrals.
