Compliance-Critical Labels
"Advance Fee" (instead of "Retainer" for non-refundable fees)

"Non-Refundable Engagement Fee" (if permitted by state bar)

"Earned Upon Receipt" (for flat fees treated as earned immediately)

"Trust Balance: $X.XX" (required on all invoices per ABA Rule 1.15)

Key Technical Requirements for Developers
Trust Accounting Safeguards:

Auto-label transactions as "Trust" or "Operating"

Prevent negative trust balances with real-time validation

Generate 3-way reconciliation reports (client ledger ⇨ trust ledger ⇨ bank statement)

Billing Precision:

Time tracking in 6-minute increments (0.1 hours)

Auto-apply jurisdictional tax rules (e.g., NY exempts legal services from sales tax)

Ethical Walls:

Matter-based access controls

Conflict check logging

This list aligns with ABA Model Rules and the Uniform Task-Based Management System (UTBMS) codes used in legal e-billing. Always include a customizable "Custom Service" field, as 23% of firms use practice-specific line items (Clio Legal Trends Report).
